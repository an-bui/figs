Photo by peggyo, iNaturalist.](peggyo-fiddler-crab.jpeg){fig-alt=\"A fiddler crab shows off their huge claw.\"}](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/97211272)\n\n## Introduction\nI gave a workshop for EEMB's R seminar where the topic was ostensibly \"publication-ready figures in ggplot\". However, since I've been thinking about these things a lot, I wanted to talk a bit about design and why it matters. There are two major questions I ask myself when making a figure (or any kind of visual):  \n1. What is the message?  \n2. How do I convey the message?  \nFor me, 1) is sometimes the hardest part, but once I figure it out I feel pretty set. But 2) takes into account design and requires me to think critically about the audience, the medium in which I am presenting this message (e.g. in a paper, poster, talk), and the way I design a plot to wrap that all up.  \n\nAddressing 2) means I share whatever bad thing I've made to get feedback on how to make it better. **This is a very important step!** No matter how much I _think_ something is good, I am ultimately not the best judge of how the message is conveyed: an audience is. I am very lucky to have friends and colleagues who will tell me gently but honestly that a figure is trash. I am very grateful for these people. After many iterations, I will hopefully come up with something I am happy with.  \n\nThe problem with executing 2) is that often, making things \"good\" is often a barrier to making things at all. I used to struggle when presented with a new project because I didn't want to make something bad (whatever that means). I could stand on a soapbox to talk about why our training (as people, as academics, whatever) makes this hard, but after lots of trial and error I've discovered that the best way of making things is exactly that: through trial and error. If you start out making something bad and you're able to make it better, that means you've learned something along the way. This!! is good!! But that means you have to get over the initial step to make bad things.    \n\nThe materials for this workshop are written for when you're in the phase of addressing 2) - you know what your message is, but you're figuring out how best to convey it through color, shape, etc. There are plenty of options in R for you to do this, but I've found that `ggplot` is the most straight-forward way for me to wrap my mind around customizing plots. In the spirit of \"just make bad things so you can learn to make good things\", I wrote this workshop so we could make the ugliest plot possible. I got my inspiration for this from Emily Riederer's [ugliest ggplot gist](https://gist.github.com/emilyriederer/2bf4f67d7e198f8359b61706c82e42ee). \n\n## Code \n\n### Set up\n\nI used data from the [`lterdatasampler` package](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/index.html), which provides little data vignettes from various Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites in the US. I chose the [fiddler crab dataset](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/articles/pie_crab_vignette.html) from the Plum Island Ecosystem LTER. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for general cleaning, ggplot\nlibrary(patchwork) # for putting multipanel plots together\nlibrary(magick) # for making images vectors\nlibrary(lubridate) # for working with dates\nlibrary(lterdatasampler) # data package\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Data\n\nThis is a data set of crab sizes (column size) from Summer 2016 at 13 different marshes spanning 12 degrees latitude. Here's a sample:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 9\n  date       latitude site   size air_temp air_temp_sd water_temp water_…¹ name \n  <date>        <dbl> <chr> <dbl>    <dbl>       <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>\n1 2016-07-29     34   ZI     8.29     18.6        8.40       20.2     7.65 Zeke…\n2 2016-08-13     42.7 PIE   17.9      10.3        9.45       14.3     4.84 Plum…\n3 2016-07-29     34   ZI    12.0      18.6        8.40       20.2     7.65 Zeke…\n4 2016-07-29     34   ZI    12.7      18.6        8.40       20.2     7.65 Zeke…\n5 2016-07-28     33.3 NIB   15.9      19.0        7.99       21.1     7.16 Nort…\n# … with abbreviated variable name ¹​water_temp_sd\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI made some adjustments because I wanted to plot things by month (for extra chaos).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrab_data <- pie_crab %>% \n  # extracting month from the date column using lubridate::month()\n  # also making this a factor (instead of numeric) using as.factor()\n  mutate(month = as.factor(month(date)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n### `ggplot` grammar\n\n`ggplot` works in layers. The code to make a plot can vary, but always includes:  \n1. the `ggplot()` call: this tells R that you want to use the function `ggplot()` in `ggplot` to plot things.  \n2. `data` and `aesthetics` within that `ggplot()` call: tells `ggplot` to use a specific data frame any variables in that data frame that should be represented in the plot (for example, x- and y- axes, colors, shapes)  \n3. a `geom_()`: short for \"geometry\", `geom_()` calls tell `ggplot` what kind of plot you want to make.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# step 1: call ggplot\nggplot(\n  \n  # step 2: specify the data and the aesthetics\n  # plotting latitude on the x-axis and crab size on the y-axis\n  data = crab_data, aes(x = latitude, y = size)) +\n  \n  # step 3: specify a geom - in this case, we're creating a scatter plot\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/basic-ggplot-1.png){fig-align='center' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Aesthetics\n\n`aes`thetics refer to anything in your data that you want rendered in your visualization: axes, colors, shapes, etc. When starting your `ggplot` object, you already have some calls in the `aes()` function: `x = latitude` and `y = size`. You can adjust the `aes`thetics of any variables you want: for example, if you wanted to color your points by site, you would include `color = site` in the `aes()` call. **Important troubleshooting tip:** if you _are_ trying to color your points by site but it's not working, double check that your `color` argument is actually in `aes()`. If you've specified color outside the `aes()`, then it'll be applied independently of site.  \n\nI'm adjusting the `aes()` for the following plot to make sure that each site has a different color and each month has a different shape.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = crab_data, aes(x = latitude, y = size)) +\n  # putting the aesthetics in here: color points by site, shape points by month\n  geom_point(aes(color = site, shape = month), \n  # anything that doesn't have to do with variables (like point size or transparency) goes outside the aesthetics\n              size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +\n  # facet by month\n  facet_wrap(~ month)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/aesthetics-adjustment-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Adjustments to defaults\n\n#### Manual selections\nYou can adjust the colors, shapes, axis limits, etc. using one of the `scale_` functions (try `?scale_` to see the many options).\n\n#### Themes\nA lot of customization comes from `ggplot` themes. Theme elements deal with everything else in the plot that _doesn't_ have to do with the data (e.g. the plot background, grid, etc.). There are a lot of arguments that you can stack up in `theme()` (try `?theme()` to see all of them), but they generally fall into a few categories: 1. axes, 2. legends, 3. panels, 4, plots, 5, strips. There are built-in themes in `ggplot` that can make your plot look pretty good right away, but playing around with theme elements yourself is a great way of getting the exact plot you want.  \n\nAdditionally, every argument takes a function modifying the _elements_: 1. lines, 2. rectangles (more broadly, shapes), 3. text. See the help pages for these functions (e.g. `?element_text()`) to figure out what you can alter about each element - there's a lot!  \n\n#### Annotations\nAnnotations are useful when you want to point something out on a plot. The function is `annotate()`, which adds an annotation layer onto your plot.\n\n#### Labels\nLastly, you can adjust any text on labels using the `labs()` function.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrab_plot <- ggplot(data = crab_data, aes(x = latitude, y = size)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = site, shape = month), size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(~ month) +\n  \n  # scaling\n  # changing point colors + assigning each to a site\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"BC\" = \"#687f47\", \"CC\" = \"#268e86\", \"CT\" = \"#373f1f\", \n                                \"DB\" = \"#03010a\", \"GTM\" = \"#447c49\", \"JC\" = \"#2e2747\", \n                                \"NB\" = \"#7f696a\", \"NIB\" = \"#777a76\", \"PIE\" = \"#a87445\", \n                                \"RC\" = \"#aef23a\", \"SI\" = \"#e05357\", \"VCR\" = \"#087f0c\", \n                                \"ZI\" = \"#010201\")) +\n  # changing the point shapes\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(\"7\" = 21, \"8\" = 18)) +\n  # changing x and y axis limits and breaks\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(29, 45)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +\n  \n  # theme() call\n  theme(\n    # panel: anything having to do with the main area\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#B5C7F4', color = '#F761F9', linewidth = 5),\n    panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = \"#87Bf18\", linewidth = 2),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"#FF21E1\", linetype = 6),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(color = \"#2D65BF\", linetype = 4),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n    \n    # plot: anything having to do with the area around the panel\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#98FC6A\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 30, hjust = 0.25, family = \"Helvetica\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 20, hjust = 0.75, color = \"#2A23A3\", family = \"Times New Roman\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, angle = 25, family = \"Comic Sans MS\"),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(1, 4, 1, 3), \"cm\"), \n    \n    # axes: anything having to do with the x- and y- axes\n    axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold.italic\", color = \"#9254D3\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(family = \"Arial\", face = \"bold\", size = 20, hjust = 0.25),\n    axis.text = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 15),\n    # note that axis.text options from above are inherited\n    axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(angle = 180),\n    \n    # strips: anything having to do with the facet titles\n    strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"#C9E886\"),\n    strip.text = element_text(color = \"#854EED\", family = \"Garamond\", face = \"bold\"),\n    \n    # legend: anything having to do with the legend\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"#DC86E8\"), \n    legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"#C2F774\"),\n    legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.justification = \"left\",\n    legend.title = element_text(family = \"serif\", color = \"#B452F9\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(color = \"#30F92C\", family = \"mono\")\n  ) +\n  \n  # annotate: big gap\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 32, y = 20, label = \"big gap\", color = \"#CC107D\") +\n  \n  # labs: anything having to do with labels\n  labs(title = \"Crabs!\",\n       subtitle = \"I love crabs\",\n       x = \"Latitude (low to high)\",\n       y = \"Size (small to big)\",\n       caption = \"Do you love crabs?\",\n       col = \"I love colors!\") \n\ncrab_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/theming-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Extras\n\n#### Adding images to plots\n\nThere are many ways of adding images to plots. The package I'll use is `magick`. This is a round-about way of getting an image in, but allows you to be flexible with your image types (gifs, etc.). I'll just save this as an object called `crab_image` to use later.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# use magick::image_read() to read in the jpeg\ncrab_image <- image_read(\"peggyo-fiddler-crab.jpeg\") %>% \n  # turn this into a raster\n  as.raster()\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Putting plots together\n\nThere are a couple packages you can use to put plots together like panels in a figure. The big ones are `patchwork` and `cowplot`. Try each of them out and see what you like, but we'll be using `patchwork` today.\n\nJust to demonstrate how this works, I'm going to make up a histogram of crab sizes. The code is annotated if you're interested in the customized aesthetics, but they're not important for this demonstration.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# for a histogram, you don't need y in your aesthetic call\ncrab_hist <- ggplot(crab_data, aes(x = size)) +\n  # telling ggplot that you want to plot a histogram\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, aes(fill = site)) +\n  # some scaling\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 6.5, to = 24.5, by = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 45), expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"BC\" = \"#7D9084\", \"CC\" = \"#8B9FD9\", \"CT\" = \"#DDD5D5\", \n                               \"DB\" = \"#CADDA5\", \"GTM\" = \"#DF697F\", \"JC\" = \"#E09E5F\", \n                               \"NB\" = \"#7F56DB\", \"NIB\" = \"#D8DF5D\", \"PIE\" = \"#DC53D3\", \n                               \"RC\" = \"#84D9DF\", \"SI\" = \"#D798D1\", \"VCR\" = \"#77E2A8\", \n                               \"ZI\" = \"#76E762\")) +\n  # some theme-ing\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#B6E45F', color = '#DABA84', linewidth = 5),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"#E16B86\", linetype = 2),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(color = \"#B49CD2\", linetype = 3),\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"#A0C8E8\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#8ADDA8\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(1, 4, 1, 3), \"cm\")\n  ) +\n  # some labeling\n  labs(x = \"Crab sizes (small to big)\",\n       y = \"Number of crabs (few to lots)\",\n       title = \"This is a crab histogram\",\n       fill = \"Places\") +\n  # adding the crab image\n  annotation_raster(crab_image, xmin = 8, xmax = 10, ymin = 30, ymax = 35) +\n  # annotating the plot with the photographer credit\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 9, y = 29, label = \"peggyo, iNaturalist\", size = 3)\n  \ncrab_hist\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/crab-histogram-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`patchwork` thinks similarly to `ggplot` in that it takes things in layers with `+` signs, but also takes `&`. To be honest, I can't remember the rules most of the time and I have to look them up.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# this automatically recognizes that you're putting plots together (no function call!)\ncrab_plots_together <- crab_plot + crab_hist + \n  \n  # plot_layout: anything having to do with the way plots are arranged\n  # widths takes a ratio: the panel ratio will be 2:1 left:right\n  plot_layout(widths = c(2, 1)) + \n  \n  # plot_annotation: anything having to do with annotations\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = \"A\", tag_suffix = \")\") & # annotating them with panel letters\n  \n  # patchwork has its own theme options!\n  theme(plot.tag = element_text(size = 40)) # changing the size of the annotations\n\n# display our beautiful plot  \ncrab_plots_together\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/crab-patchwork-1.png){width=1728}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere you have it!
