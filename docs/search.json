    "text": "Introduction\nI gave a workshop for EEMB’s R seminar where the topic was ostensibly “publication-ready figures in ggplot”. However, since I’ve been thinking about these things a lot, I wanted to talk a bit about design and why it matters. There are two major questions I ask myself when making a figure (or any kind of visual):\n1. What is the message?\n2. How do I convey the message?\nFor me, 1) is sometimes the hardest part, but once I figure it out I feel pretty set. But 2) takes into account design and requires me to think critically about the audience, the medium in which I am presenting this message (e.g. in a paper, poster, talk), and the way I design a plot to wrap that all up.\nFor me, addressing 2) means I share whatever bad thing I’ve made to get feedback on how to make it better. This is a very important step! No matter how much I think something is good, I am ultimately not the best judge of how the message is conveyed - an audience is. I am very lucky to have friends and colleagues who will tell me gently but honestly that a figure is trash. I am very grateful for these people. After many iterations, I will hopefully come up with something I am happy with.\nThe problem with executing 2) is that often, making things “good” is often a barrier to making things at all. I used to struggle when presented with a new project because I didn’t want to make something bad (whatever that means). I could stand on a soapbox to talk about why our training (as people, as academics, whatever) makes this hard, but after lots of trial and error I’ve discovered that the best way of making things is exactly that: through trial and error. If you start out making something bad and you’re able to make it better, that means you’ve learned something along the way. This!! is good!! But that means you have to get over the initial step to make bad things.\nThe materials for this workshop are written for when you’re in the phase of addressing 2) - you know what your message is, but you’re figuring out how best to convey it through color, shape, etc. There are plenty of options in R for you to do this, but I’ve found that ggplot is the most straight-forward way for me to wrap my mind around customizing plots. In the spirit of “just make bad things so you can learn to make good things”, I wrote this workshop so we could make the ugliest plot possible. I got my inspiration for this from Emily Riederer’s ugliest ggplot gist."
