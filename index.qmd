# About
I have a lot of scattered thoughts about data visualization, and this site is a repository for those thoughts. I've compiled posts summarizing data visualization workshops I've led and resources that I don't want to lose track of.

# What kinds of figs?
I love Mission figs. I hated figs as a kid so I didn't appreciate the fig tree we had in the backyard - the tree is gone now, so I'm sad I didn't eat all the figs I could back then. My love for figs has grown as an adult and hasn't waned.
